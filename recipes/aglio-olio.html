    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Classic Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is easy to make with just 4 simple ingredients (spaghetti, olive oil, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes), it comes together in 20 minutes, and it is always such a winner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li> 
        <li>Optional garnishes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti. Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.</li>
        <li>Sauté the garlic.  Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta in the sauce.  Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        <li>Taste and season. Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve. Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.</li>
    </ol>
